# morseCodeMIPS
A MIPS script to encode and decode Morse code 


I took a couple course in computer architecture which taught me a ton about the processor datapath and memory heirarchies of modern computers. While studying this material I had the chance to learn a couple assembly languages including MIPS and x86.

This is a script I wrote in MIPS to encrypt and decrypt Morse code live as it's typed. This project in particular helped solidify my understanding of how basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals and functions get handled at a more fundamental level, by translating into jumps, comparisons, and branches.
